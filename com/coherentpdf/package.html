<p>Jcpdf is a Java interface to the cpdf pdf tools. More information,
including commercial licenses can be found at <a href="https://www.coherentpdf.com/">https://www.coherentpdf.com/</a></p>

<p>The sofware is free for non-commercial use. The non-commercial home of this
software is <a href="https://community.coherentpdf.com/">https://community.coherentpdf.com/</a></p>

<h3>Obtaining and installing the DLLs</h3>

<p>The DLLs "cpdf" and "jcpdf" are required. The "cpdf" DLL is free
for non-commercial use. Commercial use requires a license. The DLLs can be
obtained here for all platforms here:</p>

<p>Before using the library, you must make sure your project or build environment
has access to the jcpdf and cpdf DLLs, which are not part of the Java .jar.</p>

<p>The java library invokes LoadLibrary on the jcpdf DLL, and so it must be placed
in your java.library.path. The cpdf DLL itself will be searched for not by
Java, but by your system, as a dependency of jcpdf.</p>

<p>Windows: Files should be named jcpdf.dll and libcpdf.dll. Put jcpdf.dll in your
java.library.path and then libcpdf.dll in the same folder, or in a standard
location such as System32.</p>

<p>Linux: Files should be named libjcpdf.so and libcpdf.so. Put libjcpdf.so in
your java.library.path. You must put libcpdf.so in a standard location such as
/usr/local/lib, or set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Simply putting it in the same folder as
libjcpdf.so will not work.</p>

<p>MacOS: Files should be named libjcpdf.dylib and libcpdf.so. Put libjcpdf.dylib
in java.library.path. You can put libcpdf.so in the same folder - it will be
picked up automatically.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Full manual (required reading):
<a href="https://coherentpdf.com/jcpdflibmanual.pdf">https://coherentpdf.com/jcpdflibmanual.pdf</a></p>

<p>Follow the instructions at the end of Chapter 1 to write your first program.</p>

<p>In addition, the Jcpdf package provides documentation with each function, which
you can view in your IDE.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Create an instance of the library with, for example <code>Jcpdf.jcpdf = new Jcpdf()</code>. You must call <code>startup()</code> to initialise the library prior to calling any other function.</p>

<p>PDFs are of type <code>Jcpdf.Pdf</code>. Page ranges are of type <code>Jcpdf.Range</code>. Both PDFs and ranges are not automatically garbage-collected. Use <code>try</code> or the <code>close()</code> method to dispose of them.</p>

<p>Exceptions are of type <code>Jcpdf.CpdfError</code> and may be raised by any function.</p>
